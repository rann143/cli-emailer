Script to send emails from the command line

## How To Use:
- Clone repository
- Install dependencies in requirements.txt
- Create a .env file to hold your gmail credentials in environment variables USERNAME & PASS
- Run script & follow input prompts for recipients email, subject line, and message body

## IMPORTANT
- Use a separate gmail from your primary gmail if you have one. I'd recommend creating a new gmail to use this script
- For purposes of experimenting with this, the .env should be fine, but note that holding your credentials in a .env file on your local system isn't necessarily secure
